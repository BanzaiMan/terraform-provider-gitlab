# gitlab_topic (Resource)

The `gitlab_topic` resource allows to manage the lifecycle of topics that are then assignable to projects.

-> Topics are the successors for project tags. Aside from avoiding terminology collisions with Git tags, they are more descriptive and better searchable.

~> Deleting a topic was implemented in GitLab 14.9. For older versions of GitLab set `soft_destroy = true` to empty out a topic instead of deleting it.
